**Why Is Property Registration Important?**

Registration of property is an attestation of ownership. In Karnataka, property doesn't belong to the buyer until the sale deed is registered. Registration protects purchasers from fraud, provides clear ownership, and enables them to sell or mortgage the property later.

**Procedure to Get Property Registered in Bangalore, Karnataka**

**Verification of Documents: Before you sign up, check with vital records:**

•	Sale deed or title deed 

•	Encumbrance certificate (EC) 

•	Latest tax paid receipts 

•	Approved building plan (if applicable) 

•	And this holds even more value when purchasing [property in Bangalore](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1moS4ihipYZPcXfEA), which has expanded so rapidly that many layouts are unauthorized. 

**Stamp Duty and Registration Fees**

•	The purchaser should also pay stamp duty, which is relatively low compared to the property's market value. Stamp duty in Karnataka is generally around 2%–5%. Buyers must also pay a registration fee of 1% of the property's value, and they can make the payments online using the Kaveri portal. 

**Drafting the Sale Deed**

•	The sale deed is the most crucial document in the process. It details the buyer and seller, provides a complete description of the property, and describes the terms of the acquisition. Ensure you draft the sale deed adequately, as it is the ultimate legal evidence of property ownership. 

**Visit the Sub-Registrar's Office**

•	The buyer and the seller must visit the sub-registrar's office where the property in Karnataka is situated. In addition to the original document, buyers must bring witnesses with valid ID proof, and the sub-registrar checks everything before registration. 

**Biometric Verification and Registration** 

•	The buyer, seller, and witnesses must provide biometric proof in Karnataka. Upon authentication, the sale deed is registered and documented in public registers. 

**Collection of Registered Documents** 

•	After successful registration, the buyer will receive the Registered sale deed. The Kaveri Online Services portal also uploads a digital copy for reference. 

**Property Registration in Bangalore**

•	The need for caution is highest among all the major cities for homebuyers, who are at greater risk due to demand and large-scale unauthorized construction. Before registering, ensure the property is BDA-approved (Bangalore Development Authority), BBMP, or RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority). A named builder manages all paperwork and registration to ensure a seamless process.
